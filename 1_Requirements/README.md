# DOORSENSOR
## INTRODUCTION:

Door sensor have been used now-a-days in many hosues.Door sensors are an essential component of our home security system. This can be built easily by using atmega328, the voltage sources, the switch and an LED. Door sensors are mainly used to indicate our house door are closed or not when we go outside with our famil or for some other occasions. 

This project is about building an embedded product called door sensor. This project will be very usefull and indicate our door is closed properly or not. When the door is open the LED will be ON, at that time LED acts as an indication that our door is open. If we close the door LED will be OFF.

## COMPONENTS:

* ATmega328
* LED
* 100 Ohm Resistor
* Fixed voltage source(5 volt)
* Switch
* Variable voltage sources

## Introduction to ATMega microcontroller:

Microchip's ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-pin AVR Microcontroller that uses RISC architecture and includes a 32KB flash-type programme memory. The Atmega328 microcontroller is found in the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Nano boards. It has a 1 KB EEPROM memory and a 2 KB SRAM memory. It features eight pins for ADC operations, which come together to form PortA (PA0â€“PA7).

Because of its advanced RISC design, the ATmega328P is a high-performance, low-power 8-bit AVR microcontroller that can execute 131 strong instructions in a single clock cycle. It's a CPU that's typically seen in Arduino boards like the Arduino Fio and Arduino Uno.

## Voltage source:

Voltage source always delivers a constant voltage irrespective of current. It has zero or very low internal resistance. A voltage source, such as a battery or generator, creates a potential difference (voltage) between two points in an electrical circuit, which allows current to flow.

## LED:

The term "light emitting diode" refers to a device that emits light. In comparison to incandescent light bulbs, LED lighting products produce light up to 90% more effectively. It works by passing an electrical current through a microchip, which ignites the tiny light sources known as LEDs, producing visible light as a result.
 
## BENIFITS:

* No major installation issues.
* Wireless door sensor that isn't expensive.
* No more juggling with the keys.
* Enhances home security.

## ADVANTAGES:

* High security.
* No more keys.
* Less maintainance.

## DISADVATAGES

* Circit damage.
* LED damage.

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

| RID  | DESCRIPTION | STATUS      |
------------------------------------
| HLR1 | C LANGUAGE  | IMPLEMENTED |
| HLR2 | OS WINDOWS  | IMPLEMENTED |
| HLR3 | OS LINUX    | IMPLEMENTED |
| HLR4 | HARD DISK   | IMPLEMENTED |
| HLR5 | RAM 4GB     | IMPLEMENTED |

## OBJECTIVES:

* Door sensor's can be used in may places such as home, hospital,offices etc,.
* Security is high because we used LED as a indicator.
* Door sensor's are being used a lot due to its high security.

## CONCLUSION:

As the technology is growing the need for security is also growing. In this project i have tried to implement a door sensor in simple way using ATmega microcontroller. It shows our door is open or close by glowing of LED. If the door is open LED will be ON. If the door is closed LED will be OFF. This simple project will be very useful for all of us.
